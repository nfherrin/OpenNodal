OpenNodal is an open source nodal solver for nuclear reactors.
OpenNodal uses the polynomial nodal method with additive correction factors for the CMFD form solved.

The polynomial solution is achieved via a nonlinear iteration scheme described in~\cite{Smith1983Nonlinear} and~\cite{GehinPhD}.
The correction factors that couple the CMFD solve with the polynomial form of the nodal equations is described in~\cite{SmithMS}.
