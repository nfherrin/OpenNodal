# Basic Style Guide

## Fortran

- Use two spaces for indentation. No tabs.
- Fortran "keywords" should be indented. An evolving list of the "keywords" for this project is being maintained in [`vim-FORTRAN-UPPER`](https://github.com/wcdawn/vim-FORTRAN-UPPER/).

## Python

- All Python scripts (e.g., `test` directory) should be passed through the [`black`](https://pypi.org/project/black/) linter.
