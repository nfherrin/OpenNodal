# OpenNodal
An open source nodal solver for nuclear reactors.
OpenNodal is intended to primarily use the polynomial nodal method using a nonlinear iteration with additive correction factors for the finite difference form.

Currently, OpenNodal only supports a non-corrected finite-difference solution, implementation of the polynomial nodal method is ongoing and will become the default nodal method once it is complete.
